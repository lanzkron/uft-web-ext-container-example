# uft-web-ext-container-example
Example Web extensibility project to show how to create _container_ objects

This repository is meant as a companion for [the blog post on my personal blog](https://lanzkron.wordpress.com/2019/01/06/improve-your-uft-web-tests-by-adding-container-objects/).

In order to use download the `dat` folder into your UFT's installation directory. Note that since it was written the target appliation ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com)), has changed so you'll have to use your imagination.
